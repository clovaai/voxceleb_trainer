# VoxCeleb trainer

This repository contains the framework for training speaker recognition models described in the paper '_In defence of metric learning for speaker recognition_'.

### Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data preparation

The following script can be used to download and prepare the VoxCeleb dataset for training.

```
python ./dataprep.py --save_path data --download --user USERNAME --password PASSWORD 
python ./dataprep.py --save_path data --extract
python ./dataprep.py --save_path data --convert
```
In order to use data augmentation, also run:

```
python ./dataprep.py --save_path data --augment
```

In addition to the Python dependencies, `wget` and `ffmpeg` must be installed on the system.

### Training examples

- AM-Softmax:
```
python ./trainSpeakerNet.py --model ResNetSE34L --log_input True --encoder_type SAP --trainfunc amsoftmax --save_path exps/exp1 --nClasses 5994 --batch_size 200 --scale 30 --margin 0.3
```

- Angular prototypical:
```
python ./trainSpeakerNet.py --model ResNetSE34L --log_input True --encoder_type SAP --trainfunc angleproto --save_path exps/exp2 --nPerSpeaker 2 --batch_size 200
```

The arguments can also be passed as `--config path_to_config.yaml`. Note that the configuration file overrides the arguments passed via command line.

### Pretrained models

A pretrained model, described in [1], can be downloaded from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~joon/data/baseline_lite_ap.model).

You can check that the following script returns: `EER 2.1792`. You will be given an option to save the scores.

```
python ./trainSpeakerNet.py --eval --model ResNetSE34L --log_input True --trainfunc angleproto --save_path exps/test --eval_frames 400 --initial_model baseline_lite_ap.model
```

A larger model trained with online data augmentation, described in [2], can be downloaded from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~joon/data/baseline_v2_ap.model). 

The following script should return: `EER 1.1771`.

```
python ./trainSpeakerNet.py --eval --model ResNetSE34V2 --log_input True --encoder_type ASP --n_mels 64 --trainfunc softmaxproto --save_path exps/test --eval_frames 400  --initial_model baseline_v2_ap.model
```

### Implemented loss functions
```
Softmax (softmax)
AM-Softmax (amsoftmax)
AAM-Softmax (aamsoftmax)
GE2E (ge2e)
Prototypical (proto)
Triplet (triplet)
Angular Prototypical (angleproto)
```

### Implemented models and encoders
```
ResNetSE34L (SAP, ASP)
ResNetSE34V2 (SAP, ASP)
VGGVox40 (SAP, TAP, MAX)
Res2NetSE34 (SAP, ASP)
```

### Data augmentation

`--augment True` enables online data augmentation, described in [2].

### Adding new models and loss functions

You can add new models and loss functions to `models` and `loss` directories respectively. See the existing definitions for examples.

### Accelerating training

- Use `--mixedprec` flag to enable mixed precision training. This is recommended for Tesla V100, GeForce RTX 20 series or later models.

- Use `--distributed` flag to enable distributed training.

  - GPU indices should be set using the command `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3`.

  - Evaluation is not performed between epochs during training.

  - If you are running more than one distributed training session, you need to change the port.

  - At every epoch, the whole dataset is passed through **each** GPU once. Therefore `test_interval` and `max_epochs` must be divided by the number of GPUs for the same number of forward passes as single GPU training.

### Data

The [VoxCeleb](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/) datasets are used for these experiments.

The train list should contain the identity and the file path, one line per utterance, as follows:
```
id00000 id00000/youtube_key/12345.wav
id00012 id00012/21Uxsk56VDQ/00001.wav
```

The train list for VoxCeleb2 can be download from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/meta/train_list.txt) and the
test list for VoxCeleb1 from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/meta/veri_test.txt).

### Replicating the results from the paper

1. Model definitions
  - `VGG-M-40` in [1] is `VGGVox` in the repository.
  - `Thin ResNet-34` in [1] is `ResNetSE34` in the repository.
  - `Fast ResNet-34` in [1] is `ResNetSE34L` in the repository.
  - `H / ASP` in [2] is `ResNetSE34V2` in the repository.

2. For metric learning objectives, the batch size in the paper is `nPerSpeaker` multiplied by `batch_size` in the code. For the batch size of 800 in the paper, use `--nPerSpeaker 2 --batch_size 400`, `--nPerSpeaker 3 --batch_size 266`, etc.

3. The models have been trained with `--max_frames 200` and evaluated with `--max_frames 400`.

4. You can get a good balance between speed and performance using the configuration below.

```
python ./trainSpeakerNet.py --model ResNetSE34L --trainfunc angleproto --batch_size 400 --nPerSpeaker 2 
```
